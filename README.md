For nearly 27 years I navigated life without any passport or ID and without official citizenship as stateless person, devoid of formal identification (passport) or any travel documents. <br>

Latvia unilaterally deregistered me as a resident (to nowhere) when I was still a minor child, effectively rendering me stateless without any legal recourse or court decision. They responded with a certificate stating that I was deregistered without a reasoned part why they did it. Possible violation of [UNCRC](https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/convention-rights-child) and [Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness](https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/convention-reduction-statelessness).  <br>

My legal status remained unresolved, suspended between the bureaucracies of Russia and Latvia.  <br>
Neither country acknowledged my right to belong, freedom of movement and return to home country ([UDHR](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights)), leaving me in a complex legal gray area, in undetermined state. <br>

It took almost two decades of persistent effort and struggle (sometimes, literally, living on the streets) to resolve the issue, by writing a bunch of letters (applications) to which I receive identical useless responses. <br>
